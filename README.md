# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
## Problem Statement
X Education, an online education company, offers courses for industry professionals. Every day, numerous individuals interested in their courses visit the website and explore available options. After filling out a form, these visitors are captured as leads. Following this, sales team members begin reaching out through calls, emails, and other means. While some leads convert, the majority do not. On average, the lead conversion rate at X Education is around 30%. For example, if 100 leads are acquired in a day, only about 30 will convert. To improve efficiency, the company aims to identify the highest-potential leads, known as Hot Leads. By doing so, they can direct the sales teamâ€™s efforts toward these leads, increasing the conversion rate and reducing the time spent contacting less promising prospects.
## Business Objective
Lead X has requested that we develop a model to assign a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 for each lead. This will help them identify the most promising leads and boost their conversion rate. The CEO aims for a lead conversion rate of 80%. Additionally, they want the model to account for future challenges, such as actions needed during peak times, how to effectively use the full workforce, and strategies to follow once the target is met.
